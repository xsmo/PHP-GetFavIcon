# PHP GetFavIcon

PHP GetFavIcon is a PHP script to get the favicon of any website and display it ad .png file.
It is currently not working for all sites - so this is why we need *your* help!

You can find a working demo here:
```
http://favicon.maleck.org/?domain=google.com
```
Simply replace "google.com" with another domain to get its favicon. The link will output the google icon as a .png file.
